# GameStock
The purpose of this application is to keep a repository of games and their information, with the ability for games to be added, removed, and commented on. 

Opening the application:
The GameStock folder contains a .xml build script which may be run using ant. Alternatively, you may open the extracted zip file in Eclipse.

Logging in:
The first thing you will see is the login screen. You may log in with username: admin, password: admin, if you want to use the admin account, or log in with an existing user account. If you want to create a new account, you may click "register." You will only be able to create an account with a username that has not already been taken. 

User account:
Upon logging in, you will be greeted with the game list. You may search for a game using the search box and search button. The "refresh" button will bring you back to the original list, as will doing an empty search. Using the "request" button, you may enter attributes for a game to be requested. To comment on a game, simply click on its entry and click comment. You may also comment on other users' comments. Finally, the "like" button will allow you to like a comment if the comment is selected. Currently,  you may like as many times as you want, so go nuts. We're all about positivity, so there is no dislike button. 

Admin account:
The admin screen will look similar to the user screen, but with an "add" button instead of "request," and three new buttons. You may remove a game by selecting a game and clicking "remove." The "requests" button will show the list of games requested to be added. You may click on a requested game and click "remove" or "accept" depending on if you want the entry added or discarded. You may notice that if you click "accept" while not having a game selected, teh console will berate you. But the program should't crash.
