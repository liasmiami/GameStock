# GameStock
The purpose of this application is to keep a repository of games and their information, with the ability for games to be added, removed, and commented on. 
Upon running the application file you will be asked to login. If you are not an administrator, you may choose the guest option, and input your desired username. You will see the list of games. To search by any attribute (name, date, genre, etc), simply type in the search box and click "search." If you are an administrator, you will be able to add and remove games with the "add" and "remove" buttons. Otherwise, you may use the "add" button to request that a game be added to the list. Finally, you may comment on a game by clicking on its entry and adding a comment with the comments box below. That's all!
